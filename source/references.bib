abstract = {In vitro molecular evolution creates a lot of peptide aptamers that bind to each target protein. In many cases, their binding sites on a protein surface are not known. Then, predicting the binding sites through computation within a reasonable time is desirable. With this aim, we have developed a novel system of fast and robust blind docking of a peptide to a fixed protein structure at low computational costs. Our algorithm is based on the following scheme. Representing each of the amino acid residues by a single point corresponding to its side-chain center, the structure of a target protein and that of a ligand peptide are coarse-grained. The peptide, which is described as a flexible bead model, is movable along the grid-points which are set surrounding the protein. An arbitrary state of the protein-peptide complex is subjected to Delaunay tessellation. Then, the fitness of a peptide-coordination to the protein is measured by a four-body statistical pseudo-potential. Through 1000 trials of a simple hill-climbing optimization, the best 15 peptide-coordinations with the 1st-15th highest fitness values are selected as candidates for the putative coordination. Retrieving the available 28 protein-peptide complexes from the Protein Databank, we carried out the blind docking test for each system. The best 15 peptide-coordinations fell into several clusters by the cluster analysis based on their spatial distribution. We found that, in most cases, the largest cluster or second largest cluster correspond to nearly correct binding sites, and that the mean (+/- standard deviation) of GTGD over all the 28 cases is 4.8 A(+/-3.8 A), where GTGD represents the distance from the putative binding site to the correct binding site.},

abstract = {Identifying a protein's functional sites is an important step towards characterizing its molecular function. Numerous structure- and sequence-based methods have been developed for this problem. Here we introduce ConCavity, a small molecule binding site prediction algorithm that integrates evolutionary sequence conservation estimates with structure-based methods for identifying protein surface cavities. In large-scale testing on a diverse set of single- and multi-chain protein structures, we show that ConCavity substantially outperforms existing methods for identifying both 3D ligand binding pockets and individual ligand binding residues. As part of our testing, we perform one of the first direct comparisons of conservation-based and structure-based methods. We find that the two approaches provide largely complementary information, which can be combined to improve upon either approach alone. We also demonstrate that ConCavity has state-of-the-art performance in predicting catalytic sites and drug binding pockets. Overall, the algorithms and analysis presented here significantly improve our ability to identify ligand binding sites and further advance our understanding of the relationship between evolutionary sequence conservation and structural and functional attributes of proteins. Data, source code, and prediction visualizations are available on the ConCavity web site (http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/concavity/).},

@article{Brenke2009,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The binding sites of proteins generally contain smaller regions that provide major contributions to the binding free energy and hence are the prime targets in drug design. Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray crystallography demonstrates that such 'hot spot' regions bind a large variety of small organic molecules, and that a relatively high 'hit rate' is predictive of target sites that are likely to bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine the 'hot spots' computationally rather than experimentally. RESULTS: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number of small organic probe molecules. The search is based on the extremely efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach which can sample billions of probe positions on dense translational and rotational grids, but can use only sums of correlation functions for scoring and hence is generally restricted to very simple energy expressions. The novelty of FTMAP is that we were able to incorporate and represent on grids a detailed energy expression, resulting in a very accurate identification of low-energy probe clusters. Overlapping clusters of different probes are defined as consensus sites (CSs). We show that the largest CS is generally located at the most important subsite of the protein binding site, and the nearby smaller CSs identify other important subsites. Mapping results are presented for elastase whose structure has been solved in aqueous solutions of eight organic solvents, and we show that FTMAP provides very similar information. The second application is to renin, a long-standing pharmaceutical target for the treatment of hypertension, and we show that the major CSs trace out the shape of the first approved renin inhibitor, aliskiren. AVAILABILITY: FTMAP is available as a server at http://ftmap.bu.edu/.},

abstract = {In this study, we assess on a large scale the possibility of deriving self-inhibitory peptides from protein domains with globular architectures. Such inhibitory peptides would inhibit interactions of their origin domain by mimicking its mode of binding to cognate partners, and could serve as promising leads for rational design of inhibitory drugs. For our large-scale analysis, we analyzed short linear segments that were cut out of protein interfaces in silico in complex structures of protein-protein docking Benchmark 3.0 and CAPRI targets from rounds 1-19. Our results suggest that more than 50\% of these globular interactions are dominated by one short linear segment at the domain interface, which provides more than half of the original interaction energy. Importantly, in many cases the derived peptides show strong energetic preference for their original binding mode independently of the context of their original domain, as we demonstrate by extensive computational peptide docking experiments. As an in depth case study, we computationally design a candidate peptide to inhibit the EphB4-EphrinB2 interaction based on a short peptide derived from the G-H loop in EphrinB2. Altogether, we provide an elaborate framework for the in silico selection of candidate inhibitory molecules for protein-protein interactions. Such candidate molecules can be readily subjected to wet-laboratory experiments and provide highly promising starting points for subsequent drug design.},

Although these regions apparently constitute fertile grounds for intermolecular interactions, no general algorithm has yet been developed that can predict hot spots based solely on their shape or composition. The discovery of structural plasticity in hot spot regions indicates that dynamic simulation techniques may be essential for achieving a predictive understanding of binding interface energetics. Future progress will depend as much on the application of new computational approaches for dissecting protein interfaces as on expanding our empirical databank of mutagenic substitutions and their effects. Despite our current theoretical shortcomings, recent methodological advances provide efficient experimental means of probing hot spots and enable immediate applications for hot spots in drug discovery.},

abstract = {Protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions are often controlled by few strong contacts that involve hot spot residues. Computational detection of such contacts, termed here anchoring spots, is important for understanding recognition processes and for predicting interactions; it is an essential step in designing interaction interfaces and therapeutic agents. We describe ANCHORSMAP, an algorithm for computational mapping of amino acid side chains on protein surfaces. The algorithm consists of two stages: A geometry based stage (LSMdet), in which sub-pockets adequate for binding single side chains are detected and amino acid probes are scattered near them, and an energy based stage in which optimal positions of the probes are determined through repeated energy minimization and clustering of nearby poses and their DeltaG are calculated. ANCHORSMAP employs a new function for DeltaG calculations, which is specifically designed for the context of protein-protein recognition by introducing a correction in the electrostatic energy term that compensates for the dielectric shielding exerted by a hypothetical protein bound to the probe. The algorithm successfully detects known anchoring sites and accurately positions the probes. The calculated DeltaG rank high the correct anchoring spots in maps produced for unbound proteins. We find that Arg, Trp, Glu and Tyr, which are favorite hot spot residues, are also more selective of their binding environment. The usefulness of anchoring spots mapping is demonstrated by detecting the binding surfaces in the protein-protein complex barnase/barstar and the protein-peptide complex kinase/PKI, and by identifying phenylalanine anchoring sites on the surface of the nuclear transporter NTF2, C-terminus anchors on PDZ domains and phenol anchors on thermolysin. Finally, we discuss the role of anchoring spots in molecular recognition processes.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze conformational changes by comparing 10 different structures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM), a four-domain enzyme in which both substrate binding and catalysis require substantial movement of the C-terminal domain. We focus on changes in interdomain and active site crevices using a method called computational solvent mapping rather than superimposing the structures. The method places molecular probes (i.e., small organic molecules containing various functional groups) around the protein to find hot spots. One of the most important hot spots is in the active site, consistent with the ability of the enzyme to bind both glucose and mannose phosphosugar substrates. The protein has eight additional hot spots at domain-domain interfaces and hinge regions. The locations and nature of six of these hot spots vary between the open, half-open, and closed conformers of the enzyme, in good agreement with the ligand-induced conformational changes. In the closed structures the number of probe clusters at the hinge region significantly depends on the position of the phosphorylated oxygen in the substrate (e.g., glucose 1-phosphate versus glucose 6-phosphate), but the protein remains almost unchanged in terms of the overall RMSD, indicating that computational solvent mapping is a more sensitive approach to detect changes in binding sites and interdomain crevices. Focusing on multidomain proteins we show that the subresolution conformational differences revealed by the mapping are in fact significant, and present a general statistical method of analysis to determine the significance of rigid body domain movements in X-ray structures.},

Flexible peptides that fold upon binding to another protein molecule mediate a large number of regulatory interactions in the living cell and may provide highly specific recognition modules. We present Rosetta FlexPepDock ab-initio, a protocol for simultaneous docking and de-novo folding of peptides, starting from an approximate specification of the peptide binding site. Using the Rosetta fragments library and a coarse-grained structural representation of the peptide and the receptor, FlexPepDock ab-initio samples efficiently and simultaneously the space of possible peptide backbone conformations and rigid-body orientations over the receptor surface of a given binding site. The subsequent all-atom refinement of the coarse-grained models includes full side-chain modeling of both the receptor and the peptide, resulting in high-resolution models in which key side-chain interactions are recapitulated. The protocol was applied to a benchmark in which peptides were modeled over receptors in either their bound backbone conformations or in their free, unbound form. Near-native peptide conformations were identified in 18/26 of the bound cases and 7/14 of the unbound cases. The protocol performs well on peptides from various classes of secondary structures, including coiled peptides with unusual turns and kinks. The results presented here significantly extend the scope of state-of-the-art methods for high-resolution peptide modeling, which can now be applied to a wide variety of peptide-protein interactions where no prior information about the peptide backbone conformation is available, enabling detailed structure-based studies and manipulation of those interactions.

abstract = {Menin is a tumour suppressor protein whose loss or inactivation causes multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1), a hereditary autosomal dominant tumour syndrome that is characterized by tumorigenesis in multiple endocrine organs. Menin interacts with many proteins and is involved in a variety of cellular processes. Menin binds the JUN family transcription factor JUND and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Several MEN1 missense mutations disrupt the menin-JUND interaction, suggesting a correlation between the tumour-suppressor function of menin and its suppression of JUND-activated transcription. Menin also interacts with mixed lineage leukaemia protein 1 (MLL1), a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, and functions as an oncogenic cofactor to upregulate gene transcription and promote MLL1-fusion-protein-induced leukaemogenesis. A recent report on the tethering of MLL1 to chromatin binding factor lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) by menin indicates that menin is a molecular adaptor coordinating the functions of multiple proteins. Despite its importance, how menin interacts with many distinct partners and regulates their functions remains poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structures of human menin in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND, or with an MLL1-LEDGF heterodimer. These structures show that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects on transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct surface formed by both menin and MLL1.},

We obtain high resolution models, often of sub-angstrom backbone quality, over an extensive and general benchmark that is based on a large nonredundant dataset of 89 peptide–protein interactions. Importantly, side chains of known binding motifs are modeled particularly well, typically with atomic accuracy. In addition, our protocol has improved modeling quality for the important application of cross docking to PDZ domains. We anticipate that the ability to create high resolution models for a wide range of peptide–protein complexes will have significant impact on structure-based functional characterization, controlled manipulation of peptide interactions, and on peptide-based drug design.

abstract = {Most biological processes are regulated through complex networks of transient protein interactions where a globular domain in one protein recognizes a linear peptide from another, creating a relatively small contact interface. Although sufficient to ensure binding, these linear motifs alone are usually too short to achieve the high specificity observed, and additional contacts are often encoded in the residues surrounding the motif (i.e. the context). Here, we systematically identified all instances of peptide-mediated protein interactions of known three-dimensional structure and used them to investigate the individual contribution of motif and context to the global binding energy. We found that, on average, the context is responsible for roughly 20\% of the binding and plays a crucial role in determining interaction specificity, by either improving the affinity with the native partner or impeding non-native interactions. We also studied and quantified the topological and energetic variability of interaction interfaces, finding a much higher heterogeneity in the context residues than in the consensus binding motifs. Our analysis partially reveals the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dynamic nature of peptide-mediated interactions, and suggests a global evolutionary mechanism to maximise the binding specificity. Finally, we investigated the viability of non-native interactions and highlight cases of potential cross-reaction that might compensate for individual protein failure and establish backup circuits to increase the robustness of cell networks.},

abstract = {Complex biological functions emerge through intricate protein-protein interaction networks. An important class of protein-protein interaction corresponds to peptide-mediated interactions, in which a short peptide stretch from one partner interacts with a large protein surface from the other partner. Protein-peptide interactions are typically of low affinity and involved in regulatory mechanisms, dynamically reshaping protein interaction networks. Due to the relatively small interaction surface, modulation of protein-peptide interactions is feasible and highly attractive for therapeutic purposes. Unfortunately, the number of available 3D structures of protein-peptide interfaces is very limited. For typical cases where a protein-peptide structure of interest is not available, the PepSite web server can be used to predict peptide-binding spots from protein surfaces alone. The PepSite method relies on preferred peptide-binding environments calculated from a set of known protein-peptide 3D structures, combined with distance constraints derived from known peptides. We present an updated version of the web server that is orders of magnitude faster than the original implementation, returning results in seconds instead of minutes or hours. The PepSite web server is available at http://pepsite2.russelllab.org.},

abstract = {Peptide-protein interactions are very prevalent, mediating key processes such as signal transduction and protein trafficking. How can peptides overcome the entropic cost involved in switching from an unstructured, flexible peptide to a rigid, well-defined bound structure? A structure-based analysis of peptide-protein interactions unravels that most peptides do not induce conformational changes on their partner upon binding, thus minimizing the entropic cost of binding. Furthermore, peptides display interfaces that are better packed than protein-protein interfaces and contain significantly more hydrogen bonds, mainly those involving the peptide backbone. Additionally, "hot spot" residues contribute most of the binding energy. Finally, peptides tend to bind in the largest pockets available on the protein surface. Our study is based on peptiDB, a new and comprehensive data set of 103 high-resolution peptide-protein complex structures. In addition to improved understanding of peptide-protein interactions, our findings have direct implications for the structural modeling, design, and manipulation of these interactions.},

abstract = {Binding hot spots, protein sites with high-binding affinity, can be identified using X-ray crystallography or NMR by screening libraries of small organic molecules that tend to cluster at such regions. FTMAP, a direct computational analog of the experimental screening approaches, globally samples the surface of a target protein using small organic molecules as probes, finds favorable positions, clusters the conformations and ranks the clusters on the basis of the average energy. The regions that bind several probe clusters predict the binding hot spots, in good agreement with experimental results. Small molecules discovered by fragment-based approaches to drug design also bind at the hot spot regions. To identify such molecules and their most likely bound positions, we extend the functionality of FTMAP (http://ftmap.bu.edu/param) to accept any small molecule as an additional probe. In its updated form, FTMAP identifies the hot spots based on a standard set of probes, and for each additional probe shows representative structures of nearby low energy clusters. This approach helps to predict bound poses of the user-selected molecules, detects if a compound is not likely to bind in the hot spot region, and provides input for the design of larger ligands.},

@article{Neduva2005,
abstract = {Many aspects of cell signalling, trafficking, and targeting are governed by interactions between globular protein domains and short peptide segments. These domains often bind multiple peptides that share a common sequence pattern, or "linear motif" (e.g., SH3 binding to PxxP). Many domains are known, though comparatively few linear motifs have been discovered. Their short length (three to eight residues), and the fact that they often reside in disordered regions in proteins makes them difficult to detect through sequence comparison or experiment. Nevertheless, each new motif provides critical molecular details of how interaction networks are constructed, and can explain how one protein is able to bind to very different partners. Here we show that binding motifs can be detected using data from genome-scale interaction studies, and thus avoid the normally slow discovery process. Our approach based on motif over-representation in non-homologous sequences, rediscovers known motifs and predicts dozens of others. Direct binding experiments reveal that two predicted motifs are indeed protein-binding modules: a DxxDxxxD protein phosphatase 1 binding motif with a KD of 22 microM and a VxxxRxYS motif that binds Translin with a KD of 43 microM. We estimate that there are dozens or even hundreds of linear motifs yet to be discovered that will give molecular insight into protein networks and greatly illuminate cellular processes.},

An overview is given of the methods currently used to locate and characterize ligand binding sites on protein surfaces, with focus on a novel approach: multiple solvent crystal structures (MSCS). In this method, the X-ray crystal structure of the target protein is solved in a variety of organic solvents. Each type of solvent molecule serves as a probe for complementary binding sites on the protein. The probe distribution on the protein surface allows the location of binding sites and the characterization of the potential ligand interactions within these sites. General aspects of the application of the MSCS method to porcine pancreatic elastase is discussed, and comparison of the results with those from X-ray crystal structures of elastase/inhibitor complexes is used to illustrate the potential of the method in aiding the process of rational drug design.},

abstract = {Fragment-based drug design (FBDD) starts with finding fragment-sized compounds that are highly ligand efficient and can serve as a core moiety for developing high-affinity leads. Although the core-bound structure of a protein facilitates the construction of leads, effective design is far from straightforward. We show that protein mapping, a computational method developed to find binding hot spots and implemented as the FTMap server, provides information that complements the fragment screening results and can drive the evolution of core fragments into larger leads with a minimal loss or, in some cases, even a gain in ligand efficiency. The method places small molecular probes, the size of organic solvents, on a dense grid around the protein and identifies the hot spots as consensus clusters formed by clusters of several probes. The hot spots are ranked based on the number of probe clusters, which predicts the binding propensity of the subsites and hence their importance for drug design. Accordingly, with a single exception the main hot spot identified by FTMap binds the core compound found by fragment screening. The most useful information is provided by the neighboring secondary hot spots, indicating the regions where the core can be extended to increase its affinity. To quantify this information, we calculate the density of probes from mapping, which describes the binding propensity at each point, and show that the change in the correlation between a ligand position and the probe density upon extending or repositioning the core moiety predicts the expected change in ligand efficiency.},

abstract = {The shape of the protein surface dictates what interactions are possible with other macromolecules, but defining discrete pockets or possible interaction sites remains difficult. First, there is the problem of defining the extent of the pocket. Second, one has to characterize the shape of each pocket. Third, one needs to make quantitative comparisons between pockets on different proteins. An elegant solution to these problems is to sort all surface and solvent points by travel depth and then collect a hierarchical tree of pockets. The connectivity of the tree is determined via the deepest saddle points between each pair of neighboring pockets. The resulting pocket surfaces tessellate the entire protein surface, producing a complete inventory of pockets. This method of identifying pockets also allows one to easily compute important shape metrics, including the problematic pocket volume, surface area, and mouth size. Pockets are also annotated with their lining residue lists and polarity and with other residue-based properties. Using this tree and the various shape metrics pockets can be merged, grouped, or filtered for further analysis. Since this method includes the entire surface, it guarantees that any pocket of interest will be found among the output pockets, unlike all previous methods of pocket identification. The resulting hierarchy of pockets is easy to visualize and aids users in higher level analysis. Comparison of pockets is done by using the shape metrics, avoiding the complex shape alignment problem. Example applications show that the method facilitates pocket comparison along mutational or time-dependent series. Pockets from families of proteins can be examined using multiple pocket tree alignments to see how ligand binding sites or how other pockets have changed with evolution. Our method is called CLIPPERS for complete liberal inventory of protein pockets elucidating and reporting on shape.},

Interestingly, more than 80\% of interacting fragments used in reconstructing a protein-peptide binding site were obtained from monomeric proteins of an entirely different structural classification, with an average sequence identity below 15\%. Nevertheless, geometric properties perfectly match the interaction patterns observed within monomeric proteins. We show the usefulness of our approach by redesigning the interaction scaffold of nine protein-peptide complexes, for which five of the peptides can be modeled within 1 A RMSD of the original peptide position. These data suggest that the wealth of structural data on monomeric proteins could be harvested to model protein-peptide interactions and, more importantly, that sequence homology is no prerequisite.},

abstract = {Many important protein-protein interactions are mediated by the binding of a short peptide stretch in one protein to a large globular segment in another. Recent efforts have provided hundreds of examples of new peptides binding to proteins for which a three-dimensional structure is available (either known experimentally or readily modeled) but where no structure of the protein-peptide complex is known. To address this gap, we present an approach that can accurately predict peptide binding sites on protein surfaces. For peptides known to bind a particular protein, the method predicts binding sites with great accuracy, and the specificity of the approach means that it can also be used to predict whether or not a putative or predicted peptide partner will bind. We used known protein-peptide complexes to derive preferences, in the form of spatial position specific scoring matrices, which describe the binding-site environment in globular proteins for each type of amino acid in bound peptides. We then scan the surface of a putative binding protein for sites for each of the amino acids present in a peptide partner and search for combinations of high-scoring amino acid sites that satisfy constraints deduced from the peptide sequence. The method performed well in a benchmark and largely agreed with experimental data mapping binding sites for several recently discovered interactions mediated by peptides, including RG-rich proteins with SMN domains, Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 with TRADD domains, DBC1 with Sir2, and the Ago hook with Argonaute PIWI domain. The method, and associated statistics, is an excellent tool for predicting and studying binding sites for newly discovered peptides mediating critical events in biology.},

Geometric methods to identify pockets on protein surfaces have been developed over many years but, with new algorithms, their performance is still improving. Simulation methods show promise in accounting for protein conformational variability to identify transient pockets but lack the ease of use of many of the (rigid) shape-based tools. Sequence and structure comparison approaches are benefiting from the constantly increasing size of sequence and structure databases. Energetic methods can aid identification and characterization of binding pockets, and have undergone recent improvements in the treatment of solvation and hydrophobicity. The "druggability" of a binding site is still difficult to predict with an automated procedure. The methodologies available for this purpose range from simple shape and hydrophobicity scores to computationally demanding free energy simulations.},

abstract = {Although protein-peptide interactions are estimated to constitute up to 40\% of all protein interactions, relatively little information is available for the structural details of these interactions. Peptide-mediated interactions are a prime target for drug design because they are predominantly present in signaling and regulatory networks. A reliable data set of nonredundant protein-peptide complexes is indispensable as a basis for modeling and design, but current data sets for protein-peptide interactions are often biased towards specific types of interactions or are limited to interactions with small ligands. In PepX (http://pepx.switchlab.org), we have designed an unbiased and exhaustive data set of all protein-peptide complexes available in the Protein Data Bank with peptide lengths up to 35 residues. In addition, these complexes have been clustered based on their binding interfaces rather than sequence homology, providing a set of structurally diverse protein-peptide interactions. The final data set contains 505 unique protein-peptide interface clusters from 1431 complexes. Thorough annotation of each complex with both biological and structural information facilitates searching for and browsing through individual complexes and clusters. Moreover, we provide an additional source of data for peptide design by annotating peptides with naturally occurring backbone variations using fragment clusters from the BriX database.},

@article{Bogan1998,
abstract = {Binding of one protein to another is involved in nearly all biological functions, yet the principles governing the interaction of proteins are not fully understood. To analyze the contributions of individual amino acid residues in protein-protein binding we have compiled a database of 2325 alanine mutants for which the change in free energy of binding upon mutation to alanine has been measured (available at http://motorhead. ucsf.edu/thorn/hotspot). Our analysis shows that at the level of side-chains there is little correlation between buried surface area and free energy of binding. We find that the free energy of binding is not evenly distributed across interfaces; instead, there are hot spots of binding energy made up of a small subset of residues in the dimer interface. These hot spots are enriched in tryptophan, tyrosine and arginine, and are surrounded by energetically less important residues that most likely serve to occlude bulk solvent from the hot spot. Occlusion of solvent is found to be a necessary condition for highly energetic interactions.},

@article{zerbe:2012,
abstract = {In the context of protein-protein interactions, the term "hot spot" refers to a residue or cluster of residues that makes a major contribution to the binding free energy, as determined by alanine scanning mutagenesis. In contrast, in pharmaceutical research, a hot spot is a site on a target protein that has high propensity for ligand binding and hence is potentially important for drug discovery. Here we examine the relationship between these two hot spot concepts by comparing alanine scanning data for a set of 15 proteins with results from mapping the protein surfaces for sites that can bind fragment-sized small molecules. We find the two types of hot spots are largely complementary; the residues protruding into hot spot regions identified by computational mapping or experimental fragment screening are almost always themselves hot spot residues as defined by alanine scanning experiments. Conversely, a residue that is found by alanine scanning to contribute little to binding rarely interacts with hot spot regions on the partner protein identified by fragment mapping. In spite of the strong correlation between the two hot spot concepts, they fundamentally differ, however. In particular, while identification of a hot spot by alanine scanning establishes the potential to generate substantial interaction energy with a binding partner, there are additional topological requirements to be a hot spot for small molecule binding. Hence, only a minority of hot spots identified by alanine scanning represent sites that are potentially useful for small inhibitor binding, and it is this subset that is identified by experimental or computational fragment screening.},

@article{piper:2006,
abstract = {The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) correlation approach to protein-protein docking can evaluate the energies of billions of docked conformations on a grid if the energy is described in the form of a correlation function. Here, this restriction is removed, and the approach is efficiently used with pairwise interaction potentials that substantially improve the docking results. The basic idea is approximating the interaction matrix by its eigenvectors corresponding to the few dominant eigenvalues, resulting in an energy expression written as the sum of a few correlation functions, and solving the problem by repeated FFT calculations. In addition to describing how the method is implemented, we present a novel class of structure-based pairwise intermolecular potentials. The DARS (Decoys As the Reference State) potentials are extracted from structures of protein-protein complexes and use large sets of docked conformations as decoys to derive atom pair distributions in the reference state. The current version of the DARS potential works well for enzyme-inhibitor complexes. With the new FFT-based program, DARS provides much better docking results than the earlier approaches, in many cases generating 50\% more near-native docked conformations. Although the potential is far from optimal for antibody-antigen pairs, the results are still slightly better than those given by an earlier FFT method. The docking program PIPER is freely available for noncommercial applications.},
