General scheme of thesis
==========================


From peptidb we learn that hot spots are very important.
From Dima's paper (zerbe) we learn that computational fragment mapping
correlates very well with energetic contribution (hot spots)

--->

Then if we map fragments onto protein surfaces, we can find potential
hot spot locations on the surface.

We need to characterize the features of peptide-binding hot spots, and
based on that profile, we can predict where a peptide should bind.


PeptiDB2
---------

Goal: gather FTMap data on peptide-protein interactions, and
characterize specific interaction profiles

Data set features (ideal):

* high-resolution: bound structure, so we know with high confidence
  how the interface looks. unbound? also should be x-ray structure,
  because we're after the features that are also found in unbound
  structures, so it's best to eliminate artifacts as much as possible.

Knowledge dump
----------------

* PPIs:
  - are crucial in many cellular processes [citation here]
  - interfaces are in many cases broad, flat surfaces
    [cohesin-dockerin], where hot spots determine specificity.
* PePIs:
  - defined as interactions between a globular domain and a linear
    polypeptide, whether as a flexible loop/tail or a free molecule.
  - highly-prevalent, involved in many important processes
  - Structural basis of interactions
    # receptor doesn't undergo major conformational change.
    # importance of hydrogen bonds and where
    # the role that hot-spot residues play in the interfaces
  - other studies and their findings:

* Computational approaches to studying PePIs (our focus):
  - Computational fragment mapping (FTMap):
    # Rationale in short
    # Method
    # results with proteins and ligands
