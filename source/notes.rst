General scheme of thesis
==========================


From peptidb we learn that hot spots are very important.
From Dima's paper (zerbe) we learn that computational fragment mapping
correlates very well with energetic contribution (hot spots)

--->

Then if we map fragments onto protein surfaces, we can find potential
hot spot locations on the surface.

We need to characterize the features of peptide-binding hot spots, and
based on that profile, we can predict where a peptide should bind.


PeptiDB2
---------

Goal: gather FTMap data on peptide-protein interactions, and
characterize specific interaction profiles

Data set features (ideal):

* high-resolution: bound structure, so we know with high confidence
  how the interface looks. unbound? also should be x-ray structure,
  because we're after the features that are also found in unbound
  structures, so it's best to eliminate artifacts as much as possible.
