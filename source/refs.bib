    abstract = {The innate immune response is essential for combating infectious disease. Macrophages and other cells respond to infection by releasing cytokines, such as interleukin-1\&\#178; (IL-1\&\#178;), which in turn activate a well-described, myeloid-differentiation factor 88 (MYD88)-mediated, nuclear factor-\&\#186;B (NF-\&\#186;B)-dependent transcriptional pathway that results in inflammatory-cell activation and recruitment. Endothelial cells, which usually serve as a barrier to the movement of inflammatory cells out of the blood and into tissue, are also critical mediators of the inflammatory response. Paradoxically, the cytokines vital to a successful immune defence also have disruptive effects on endothelial cell\&\#19;cell interactions and can trigger degradation of barrier function and dissociation of tissue architecture. The mechanism of this barrier dissolution and its relationship to the canonical NF-\&\#186;B pathway remain poorly defined. Here we show that the direct, immediate and disruptive effects of IL-1\&\#178; on endothelial stability in a human in vitro cell model are NF-\&\#186;B independent and are instead the result of signalling through the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and its activator ARF nucleotide binding site opener (ARNO; also known as CYTH2). Moreover, we show that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and thus propose MYD88\&\#19;ARNO\&\#19;ARF6 as a proximal IL-1\&\#178; signalling pathway distinct from that mediated by NF-\&\#186;B. Finally, we show that SecinH3, an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory arthritis and acute inflammation.},

    abstract = {A wide range of regulatory processes in the cell are mediated by flexible peptides that fold upon binding to globular proteins. Computational efforts to model these interactions are hindered by the large number of rotatable bonds in flexible peptides relative to typical ligand molecules, and the fact that different peptides assume different backbone conformations within the same binding site. In this study, we present Rosetta FlexPepDock, a novel tool for refining coarse peptide–protein models that allows significant changes in both peptide backbone and side chains. We obtain high resolution models, often of sub-angstrom backbone quality, over an extensive and general benchmark that is based on a large nonredundant dataset of 89 peptide–protein interactions. Importantly, side chains of known binding motifs are modeled particularly well, typically with atomic accuracy. In addition, our protocol has improved modeling quality for the important application of cross docking to PDZ domains. We anticipate that the ability to create high resolution models for a wide range of peptide–protein complexes will have significant impact on structure-based functional characterization, controlled manipulation of peptide interactions, and on peptide-based drug design.

    abstract = {The CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions) and CASP (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) experiments have demonstrated the power of community-wide tests of methodology in assessing the current state of the art and spurring progress in the very challenging areas of protein docking and structure prediction. We sought to bring the power of community-wide experiments to bear on a very challenging protein design problem that provides a complementary but equally fundamental test of current understanding of protein-binding thermodynamics. We have generated a number of designed protein–protein interfaces with very favorable computed binding energies but which do not appear to be formed in experiments, suggesting that there may be important physical chemistry missing in the energy calculations. A total of 28 research groups took up the challenge of determining what is missing: we provided structures of 87 designed complexes and 120 naturally occurring complexes and asked participants to identify energetic contributions and/or structural features that distinguish between the two sets. The community found that electrostatics and solvation terms partially distinguish the designs from the natural complexes, largely due to the nonpolar character of the designed interactions. Beyond this polarity difference, the community found that the designed binding surfaces were, on average, structurally less embedded in the designed monomers, suggesting that backbone conformational rigidity at the designed surface is important for realization of the designed function. These results can be used to improve computational design strategies, but there is still much to be learned; for example, one designed complex, which does form in experiments, was classified by all metrics as a nonbinder.

    abstract = {Interactions between Bcl-2-like proteins and BH3 domains play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis. Despite the overall structural similarity of their interaction with helical BH3 domains, Bcl-2-like proteins exhibit an intricate spectrum of binding specificities whose underlying basis is not well understood. Here, we characterize these interactions using Rosetta FlexPepBind, a protocol for the prediction of peptide binding specificity that evaluates the binding potential of different peptides based on structural models of the corresponding peptide?receptor complexes. For two prominent players, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, we obtain good agreement with a large set of experimental SPOT array measurements and recapitulate the binding specificity of peptides derived by yeast display in a previous study. We extend our approach to a third member of this family, Bcl-2: we test our blind prediction of the binding of 180 BIM-derived peptides with a corresponding experimental SPOT array. Both prediction and experiment reveal a Bcl-2 binding specificity pattern that resembles that of Bcl-xL. Finally, we extend this application to accurately predict the specificity pattern of additional human BH3-only derived peptides. This study characterizes the distinct patterns of binding specificity of BH3-only derived peptides for the Bcl-2 like proteins Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 and provides insight into the structural basis of determinants of specificity.},

                Post-translational lipidation by prenylation of the CaaX-box C-terminal motif in eukaryotic proteins facilitates anchoring of hydrophilic proteins, such as Ras and Rab, to membranes. A large cadre of bacterial effectors injected into host cells is anchored to host membranes by unknown mechanisms. As already documented for Legionella and Salmonella, we propose a common paradigm of microbial exploitation of the host prenylation machinery for anchoring of injected effectors to host membranes. This is supported by numerous potential microbial CaaX-box-containing proteins identified using refined bioinformatic tools. We also propose utilization of the CaaX motif as a membrane-targeting tag for proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells to facilitate deciphering of biological function.

                Flexible peptides that fold upon binding to another protein molecule mediate a large number of regulatory interactions in the living cell and may provide highly specific recognition modules. We present Rosetta FlexPepDock ab-initio, a protocol for simultaneous docking and de-novo folding of peptides, starting from an approximate specification of the peptide binding site. Using the Rosetta fragments library and a coarse-grained structural representation of the peptide and the receptor, FlexPepDock ab-initio samples efficiently and simultaneously the space of possible peptide backbone conformations and rigid-body orientations over the receptor surface of a given binding site. The subsequent all-atom refinement of the coarse-grained models includes full side-chain modeling of both the receptor and the peptide, resulting in high-resolution models in which key side-chain interactions are recapitulated. The protocol was applied to a benchmark in which peptides were modeled over receptors in either their bound backbone conformations or in their free, unbound form. Near-native peptide conformations were identified in 18/26 of the bound cases and 7/14 of the unbound cases. The protocol performs well on peptides from various classes of secondary structures, including coiled peptides with unusual turns and kinks. The results presented here significantly extend the scope of state-of-the-art methods for high-resolution peptide modeling, which can now be applied to a wide variety of peptide-protein interactions where no prior information about the peptide backbone conformation is available, enabling detailed structure-based studies and manipulation of those interactions.

Instead, we propose that research and development efforts be aimed at addressing the aberrant biomechanics that are the primary driver in the progression of knee OA. In particular, technologies that  unload  the joint may reverse the structural damage, which is the cardinal feature of this disease.

    abstract = {Abstract In this study, we assess on a large scale the possibility of deriving self-inhibitory peptides from protein domains with globular architectures. Such inhibitory peptides would inhibit interactions of their origin domain by mimicking its mode of binding to cognate partners, and could serve as promising leads for rational design of inhibitory drugs. For our large-scale analysis, we analyzed short linear segments that were cut out of protein interfaces in silico in complex structures of protein–protein docking Benchmark 3.0 and CAPRI targets from rounds 1–19. Our results suggest that more than 50\% of these globular interactions are dominated by one short linear segment at the domain interface, which provides more than half of the original interaction energy. Importantly, in many cases the derived peptides show strong energetic preference for their original binding mode independently of the context of their original domain, as we demonstrate by extensive computational peptide docking experiments. As an in depth case study, we computationally design a candidate peptide to inhibit the EphB4–EphrinB2 interaction based on a short peptide derived from the G-H loop in EphrinB2. Altogether, we provide an elaborate framework for the in silico selection of candidate inhibitory molecules for protein–protein interactions. Such candidate molecules can be readily subjected to wet-laboratory experiments and provide highly promising starting points for subsequent drug design.

    abstract = {Peptide-protein interactions are very prevalent, mediating key processes such as signal transduction and protein trafficking. How can peptides overcome the entropic cost involved in switching from an unstructured, flexible peptide to a rigid, well-defined bound structure? A structure-based analysis of peptide-protein interactions unravels that most peptides do not induce conformational changes on their partner upon binding, thus minimizing the entropic cost of binding. Furthermore, peptides display interfaces that are better packed than protein-protein interfaces and contain significantly more hydrogen bonds, mainly those involving the peptide backbone. Additionally, "hot spot" residues contribute most of the binding energy. Finally, peptides tend to bind in the largest pockets available on the protein surface. Our study is based on peptiDB, a new and comprehensive data set of 103 high-resolution peptide-protein complex structures. In addition to improved understanding of peptide-protein interactions, our findings have direct implications for the structural modeling, design, and manipulation of these interactions.},

@article{Da2002Linkage,
    abstract = {A method based on direct and indirect counting is developed for rapid and accurate linkage analysis for codominant and dominant loci. Methods for estimating gender-specific recombination frequencies are available for cases where at least one of the two loci is multiallelic and for biallelic loci with mixed parental linkage phases where at least one locus is codominant. Most of the estimates of gender-average and gender-specific recombination frequencies required iterative solutions. The new method makes use of the full data set, yields exact estimates of the recombination frequencies when the observed and expected genotypic frequencies are equal, and are computationally efficient. Relative efficiency of various data types is affected by the inheritance mode and by parental linkage phases of biallelic loci, but unaffected by the locus polymorphism when using the full data set for linkage analysis. The ability to determine parental linkage phases is affected by the locus polymorphism as well as inheritance mode. Intercross (or F-2 design) is more efficient for mapping codominant loci, whereas backcross is more efficient if dominance is involved. Mixed parental linkage phases of biallelic loci are less efficient than coupling or repulsion linkage phases. Ignoring noninformative offspring results in biased estimates of recombination frequency for biallelic loci only and reduced LOD scores for all cases.},

    abstract = {Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) is a serine−threonine kinase belonging to the CMGC family that plays a key role in many biological processes, such as glucose metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and proliferation. Like most protein kinases, GSK-3β is regulated via multiple pathways and sites. We performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated unbound GSK-3β and the phosphorylated GSK-3β bound to a peptide substrate, its product, and a derived inhibitor. We found that GSK-3β autophosphorylation at residue Tyr216 results in widening of the catalytic groove, thereby facilitating substrate access. In addition, we studied the interactions of the phosphorylated GSK-3β with a substrate and peptide inhibitor located at the active site and observed higher affinity of the inhibitor to the kinase. Furthermore, we detected a potential remote binding site which was previously identified in other kinases. In agreement with experiments we observed that binding of specific peptides at this remote site leads to stabilization of the activation loop located in the active site. We speculate that this stabilization could enhance the catalytic activity of the kinase. We point to this remote site as being structurally conserved and suggest that the allosteric phenomenon observed here may occur in the protein kinase superfamily.},

@article{Tenlen_Develop08,
    abstract = {Anteroposterior polarity in early C. elegans embryos is required for the specification of somatic and germline lineages, and is initiated by a sperm-induced reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton and PAR polarity proteins. Through mechanisms that are not understood, the kinases PAR-1 and PAR-4, and other PAR proteins cause the cytoplasmic zinc finger protein MEX-5 to accumulate asymmetrically in the anterior half of the one-cell embryo. We show that MEX-5 asymmetry requires neither vectorial transport to the anterior, nor protein degradation in the posterior. MEX-5 has a restricted mobility before fertilization and in the anterior of one-cell embryos. However, MEX-5 mobility in the posterior increases as asymmetry develops, presumably allowing accumulation in the anterior. The MEX-5 zinc fingers and a small, C-terminal domain are essential for asymmetry; the zinc fingers restrict MEX-5 mobility, and the C-terminal domain is required for the increase in posterior mobility. We show that a crucial residue in the C-terminus, Ser 458, is phosphorylated in vivo. PAR-1 and PAR-4 kinase activities are required for the phosphorylation of S458, providing a link between PAR polarity proteins and the cytoplasmic asymmetry of MEX-5.},

    abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To study the ability of a qualitative assessment of the common femoral Doppler waveform to screen for significant aortoiliac disease. {DESIGN:} Prospective, semi-blind study. {SETTING:} Vascular laboratory, University Hospital. {METHODS:} A total of 118 aortoiliac segments were studied in 73 patients. Each aortoiliac segment was graded as normal or abnormal from visual interpretation of the common femoral Doppler waveform obtained by colour duplex ultrasound. Full ultrasound assessment of the aortoiliac vessels acted as the "gold standard". Abnormal aortoiliac segments were defined by the presence of at least one {\\textgreater} or = 50\% diameter reducing lesion, whereas vessels considered "normal" included those with disease between 0-49\% diameter reduction. An increase in peak systolic velocity of two-fold or greater was used to define a {\\textgreater} or = 50\% diameter reducing stenosis. Agreement between common femoral waveform analysis and the duplex scans was measured by the Kappa statistic. {RESULTS:} The Kappa value for the agreement between common femoral waveform analysis and duplex scans was 0.74 (95\% {CI;} 0.62-0.86). This represents substantial agreement. Doppler waveform analysis had a sensitivity of 95\%, specificity of 80\% and accuracy of 87\% for the prediction of a significant aortoiliac stenosis seen by ultrasound. {CONCLUSION:} Visual interpretation of the common femoral Doppler waveform is a sensitive and accurate technique for the prediction of significant aortoiliac stenosis. It is of particular value when full ultrasound aortoiliac assessments are not feasible due to time constraints, obesity or the presence of bowel gas.},

    abstract = {Rats receiving a complete spinal cord transection (ST) at a neonatal stage spontaneously can recover significant stepping ability, whereas minimal recovery is attained in rats transected as adults. In addition, neonatally spinal cord transected rats trained to step more readily improve their locomotor ability. We hypothesized that recovery of stepping in rats receiving a complete spinal cord transection at postnatal day 5 (P5) is attributable to changes in the lumbosacral neural circuitry and not to regeneration of axons across the lesion. As expected, stepping performance measured by several kinematics parameters was significantly better in ST (at P5) trained (treadmill stepping for 8 weeks) than age-matched non-trained spinal rats. Anterograde tracing with biotinylated dextran amine showed an absence of labeling of corticospinal or rubrospinal tract axons below the transection. Retrograde tracing with Fast Blue from the spinal cord below the transection showed no labeled neurons in the somatosensory motor cortex of the hindlimb area, red nucleus, spinal vestibular nucleus, and medullary reticular nucleus. Retrograde labeling transsynaptically via injection of pseudorabies virus (Bartha) into the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles showed no labeling in the same brain nuclei. Furthermore, re-transection of the spinal cord at or rostral to the original transection did not affect stepping ability. Combined, these results clearly indicate that there was no regeneration across the lesion after a complete spinal cord transection in neonatal rats and suggest that this is an important model to understand the higher level of locomotor recovery in rats attributable to lumbosacral mechanisms after receiving a complete ST at a neonatal compared to an adult stage.},

The current major bottleneck is to model the conformational changes of the monomer backbone upon binding. We evaluate the use of homolog structures as source for conformational diversity, within the framework of RosettaDock - a leading high-resolution docking protocol. We find that the use of homolog templates can improve significantly the modeling of a complex structure, including known difficult cases. Several conformational changes however are not sampled by any of the templates, indicating the need for additional sources of conformational variability. Interestingly, the successful homolog templates are not restricted to a confined range of sequence identity, highlighting the importance of the backbone conformation rather than the sequence.

Here we show that loss of LOC387715 is insufficient to explain AMD susceptibility, since a nonsense mutation (R38X) in this gene that leads to loss of its message resides in a protective haplotype.

This exuberant cytokine release paradoxically injures the host by triggering leakage from capillaries, tissue edema, organ failure, and shock. Current medical therapies target individual pathogens with antimicrobial agents or directly either blunt or boost the host's immune system. We explored a third approach: activating with the soluble ligand Slit an endothelium-specific, Robo4-dependent signaling pathway that strengthens the vascular barrier, diminishing deleterious aspects of the host's response to the pathogen-induced cytokine storm. This approach reduced vascular permeability in the lung and other organs and increased survival in animal models of bacterial endotoxin exposure, polymicrobial sepsis, and H5N1 influenza. Thus, enhancing the resilience of the host vascular system to the host's innate immune response may provide a therapeutic strategy for treating multiple infectious agents.},

Intein domains can be split into two fragments and still ligate their flanks by a trans-protein-splicing reaction. A bioinformatic analysis of environmental metagenomic data revealed 26 different loci with a novel genomic arrangement. In each locus, a conserved enzyme coding region is broken in two by a split intein, with a free-standing endonuclease gene inserted in between. Eight types of DNA synthesis and repair enzymes have this 'fractured' organization. The new types of naturally split-inteins were analyzed in comparison to known split-inteins. Some loci include apparent gene control elements brought in with the endonuclease gene. A newly predicted homing endonuclease family, related to very-short patch repair (Vsr) endonucleases, was found in half of the loci. These putative homing endonucleases also appear in group-I introns, and as stand-alone inserts in the absence of surrounding intervening sequences. The new fractured genes organization appears to be present mainly in phage, shows how endonucleases can integrate into inteins, and may represent a missing link in the evolution of gene breaking in general, and in the creation of split-inteins in particular.},

    abstract = {Judgments of the intensity of a stimulus are dependent on the level of central nervous system activity it generates. Generally, it is assumed that such judgments are based on activity along modality-specific pathways. Thus, visual intensity judgments would be based on unimodal visual activity. However, many neurons do not fit neatly within modality-specific categories, but can be influenced by more than one sensory modality. Often the ``multisensory'' effect is quite pronounced. If these multisensory neurons participate in such fundamental functions as perceived intensity, the presence of a nonvisual (i.e., auditory) cue may have a significant effect on the perceived intensity of a visual cue. The results of the present study were consistent with such a hypothesis. A brief, broad-band auditory stimulus was found to significantly enhance the perceived intensity of an LED. The effect was most pronounced at the lowest visual intensities, and was evident regardless of the location of the auditory cue. However, it was present only at the location of visual fixation. Yet, despite the significant influence of the auditory cue, and its differential effect at different visual intensities, a power function that maintains the proportionality among perceived visual intensities was retained.},

    abstract = {Protein folding and binding is commonly depicted as a search for the minimum energy conformation. Modeling of protein complex structures by RosettaDock often results in a set of low-energy conformations near the native structure. Ensembles of low-energy conformations can appear, however, in other regions, especially when backbone movements occur upon binding. What then characterizes the energy landscape near the correct orientation? We applied a machine learning algorithm to distinguish ensembles of low-energy conformations around the native conformation from other low-energy ensembles. The resulting classifier, FunHunt, identifies the native orientation in 50/52 protein complexes in a test set. The features used by FunHunt teach us about the nature of native interfaces. Remarkably, the energy decrease of trajectories toward near-native orientations is significantly larger than for other orientations. This provides a possible explanation for the stability of association in the native orientation.},

    abstract = {Statistical methods are developed to estimate gender-specific and gender-average recombination frequencies between a biallelic or multiallelic marker and a sex-influenced gene. Iterative solutions are developed for intercross (or F-2 design). For biallelic markers, two iterative solutions are required, one for coupling and repulsion parental linkage phases and one for mixed parental linkage phases. For multiallelic markers, one set of iterative equations applies to all possible parental linkage phases. The resulting formulae for estimating recombination frequency use the full data set and yield estimates that are exactly the same as the true parameters if the observed and expected phenotypic distributions are equal. When one parent is homozygous for the sex-influenced gene as is expected with the backcross design, simple solutions exist for estimating recombination frequencies. However, offspring of one gender (male or female) do not have linkage information depending on whether the homozygous parent has two male-dominant or male-recessive alleles. Consequently, an F-2 design is more efficient than a backcross design for mapping a sex-influenced gene. Knowing each parental linkage phase is important to apply the methods developed in this article. It is shown that an individual's linkage phase of the sex-influenced locus can be determined based on allele transmission from the parents for all crosses except under the mating between an expressed male and an unexpressed female.},

    abstract = {Inauguration of  ” double-shift” junior secondary schooling in Trinidad and Tobago in 1973 created several problems for local planners, policy makers, parents, and students themselves. In some cases solution has been found, but in others problems have remained defiant and irresolute. In the latter category is the problem of deviant student behaviour during  ” off-shift” sessions, believed to be the result of poor student choice regarding the use of time. Recommendations have been made to redress this situation through engagement of community groups. This paper argues that this approach is problematical and contradictory and will not achieve stipulated objectives. The main reason for the gloomy outlook is the principle of decentralization, which must be taken into account in any attempt to engage the local community. Community engagement is examined against certain imperatives of decentralization. The paper concludes, however, that as a strategy, community engagement is doomed to failure. Poor choices by junior secondary school students in the use of their  ” off-shift” hours are therefore very likely to persist.},

@article{Wang2007RosettaDock,
    abstract = {A challenge in protein-protein docking is to account for the conformational changes in the monomers that occur upon binding. The RosettaDock method, which incorporates sidechain flexibility but keeps the backbone fixed, was found in previous CAPRI rounds (4 and 5) to generate docking models with atomic accuracy, provided that conformational changes were mainly restricted to protein sidechains. In the recent rounds of CAPRI (6-12), large backbone conformational changes occur upon binding for several target complexes. To address these challenges, we explicitly introduced backbone flexibility in our modeling procedures by combining rigid-body docking with protein structure prediction techniques such as modeling variable loops and building homology models. Encouragingly, using this approach we were able to correctly predict a significant backbone conformational change of an interface loop for Target 20 (12 A rmsd between those in the unbound monomer and complex structures), but accounting for backbone flexibility in protein-protein docking is still very challenging because of the significantly larger conformational space, which must be surveyed. Motivated by these CAPRI challenges, we have made progress in reformulating RosettaDock using a "fold-tree" representation, which provides a general framework for treating a wide variety of flexible-backbone docking problems.

@article{Edgerton2001Retraining,
    abstract = {The present review presents a series of concepts that may be useful in developing rehabilitative strategies to enhance recovery of posture and locomotion following spinal cord injury. First, the loss of supraspinal input results in a marked change in the functional efficacy of the remaining synapses and neurons of intraspinal and peripheral afferent (dorsal root ganglion) origin. Second, following a complete transection the lumbrosacral spinal cord can recover greater levels of motor performance if it has been exposed to the afferent and intraspinal activation patterns that are associated with standing and stepping. Third, the spinal cord can more readily reacquire the ability to stand and step following spinal cord transection with repetitive exposure to standing and stepping. Fourth, robotic assistive devices can be used to guide the kinematics of the limbs and thus expose the spinal cord to the new normal activity patterns associated with a particular motor task following spinal cord injury. In addition, such robotic assistive devices can provide immediate quantification of the limb kinematics. Fifth, the behavioural and physiological effects of spinal cord transection are reflected in adaptations in most, if not all, neurotransmitter systems in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Evidence is presented that both the GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory systems are up-regulated following complete spinal cord transection and that step training results in some aspects of these transmitter systems being down-regulated towards control levels. These concepts and observations demonstrate that (a) the spinal cord can interpret complex afferent information and generate the appropriate motor task; and (b) motor ability can be defined to a large degree by training.},

    abstract = {Significant morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes mellitus result largely from a greatly increased incidence of microvascular complications. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) are two of the most common and severe microvascular complications of diabetes. A high concordance exists in the development of PDR and ESRD in diabetic patients, as well as strong familial aggregation of these complications, suggesting a common underlying genetic mechanism. However, the precise gene(s) and genetic variant(s) involved remain largely unknown. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a potent angiogenic factor observed in the diabetic human and mouse eye. By a combination of case-control association and functional studies, we demonstrate that the T allele of SNP rs1617640 in the promoter of the EPO gene is significantly associated with PDR and ESRD in three European-American cohorts [Utah: P = 1.91 x 10(-3); Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) Study: P = 2.66 x 10(-8); and Boston: P = 2.1 x 10(-2)]. The EPO concentration in human vitreous body was 7.5-fold higher in normal subjects with the TT risk genotype than in those with the GG genotype. Computational analysis suggests that the risk allele (T) of rs1617640 creates a matrix match with the EVI1/MEL1 or AP1 binding site, accounting for an observed 25-fold enhancement of luciferase reporter expression as compared with the G allele. These results suggest that rs1617640 in the EPO promoter is significantly associated with PDR and ESRD. This study identifies a disease risk-associated gene and potential pathway mediating severe diabetic microvascular complications.},

Neurophysiol. 88: 3108-3117, 2002. Load-related afferent information modifies the magnitude and timing of hindlimb muscle activity during stepping in decerebrate animals and spinal cord-injured humans and animals, suggesting that the spinal cord mediates load-related locomotor responses. In this study, we found that stepping on a treadmill by adult rats that received complete, midthoracic spinal cord transections as neonates could be altered by loading the hindlimbs using a pair of small robotic arms. The robotic arms applied a downward force to the lower shanks of the hindlimbs during the stance phase and measured the position of the lower shank during stepping. No external force was applied during the swing phase of the step. When applied bilaterally, this stance force field perturbed the hindlimb trajectories so that the ankle position was shifted downward during stance. In response to this perturbation, both the stance and step cycle durations decreased. During swing, the hindlimb initially accelerated toward the normal, unperturbed swing trajectory and then tracked the normal trajectory. Bilateral loading increased the magnitude of the medial gastrocnemius electromyographic (EMG) burst during stance and increased the amplitude of the semitendinosus and rectus femoris EMG bursts. When the force field was applied unilaterally, stance duration decreased in the loaded hindlimb, while swing duration was decreased in the contralateral hindlimb, thereby preserving interlimb coordination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using robotic devices to mechanically modulate afferent input to the injured spinal cord during weight-supported locomotion. In addition, these results indicate that the lumbosacral spinal cord responds to load-related input applied to the lower shank during stance by modifying step timing and muscle activation patterns, while preserving normal swing kinematics and interlimb coordination. 10.1152/jn.01050.2001},
