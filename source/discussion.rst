A full ab-initio peptide-protein structure prediction protocol:

1. Optimal placement of peptide in binding site according to PeptiMap predictions
2. Calibrate FlexPepDock to start from predicted binding sites.

Example of ab-initio modeling based on hot-spot identification:

(A) the PeptiMap site that overlaps with HIV HAGPIA peptide bound to CipA protein (PDB ID 1AWR) is used to create a starting structure (B) for FlexPepDock, to create an accurate model of the interaction (C).
